This fork modifies the testing script to always generate a cocotools .json file and a .csv file containing the mAP results. It also adds a second test file modified to load trained models from a different YOLO implementation https://github.com/eriklindernoren/PyTorch-YOLOv3 so that the same tests can run on both.
